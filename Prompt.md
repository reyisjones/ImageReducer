## 1. Package / “Freeze” your app into an executable or installer

Before publishing, you need to convert your Python + PowerShell app into a distributable form so end users don’t need to install dependencies manually.

Options include:

| Method                                                                             | Pros                                                                         | Cons                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **PyInstaller / cx_Freeze / PyOxidizer / Nuitka**                                  | Bundles Python interpreter + dependencies into a single executable or folder | Produces large files; compatibility issues |
| **Installer wrappers (NSIS, Inno Setup, MSI / WiX)**                               | Creates a native installer (with shortcuts, uninstall)                       | Requires extra setup / scripting           |
| **Platform-native packaging (MSI for Windows, .app for macOS, DEB/RPM for Linux)** | Best user experience                                                         | More effort for cross-platform support     |

For Windows, a common path:

1. Use **PyInstaller** (or cx_Freeze) to generate a `.exe` (or folder) from your Python app.
2. Use **Inno Setup** or **NSIS** or **WiX** to wrap that executable into an installer `.exe` or `.msi`:

   * Create shortcuts, menu entries, uninstall logic, file associations, etc.
   * Include your PowerShell fallback logic and bundled scripts.
3. Test that the generated installer works: install, run, uninstall, clean up.

This approach ensures end users can simply download an EXE/installer and install without manual dependency setup. (This strategy is frequently used in bundling desktop Python apps) ([Gist][1])

## 2. Setup GitHub repository structure & versioning

Organize your project so it supports releases. Example structure:

```
/my-image-compressor
├── src/                  # your Python code + UI + scripts
├── assets/               # e.g. sample images, icons
├── installer/            # Inno Setup / NSIS scripts
├── tests/                # unit + UI tests
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── version.txt / version.py
├── setup.py / pyproject.toml  (optional)
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── release.yml
```

Also:

* Choose a versioning scheme (e.g. `v1.0.0`, semantic versioning).
* Use Git tags corresponding to versions (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0`).
* Use conventional commit messages or clear feature-based commits, as you planned earlier.

---

## 3. Configure a GitHub Actions workflow for building & releasing

Use GitHub Actions to automate:

* Running tests (unit + UI) on every push or PR.
* Building the distributable installer when you create a release tag.
* Uploading artifacts (installer, executable) to the GitHub release.

Here’s a sketch of a `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build and Release App

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest  # for building Windows installer

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest  # or your test command
    - name: Build executable
      run: |
        pyinstaller --onefile --windowed src/main.py  # or your build command
    - name: Create installer
      run: |
        "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inno Setup 6\\ISCC.exe" installer\\setup_script.iss
    - name: Upload installer artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: MyApp-Installer
        path: path/to/generated/installer.exe
```

Then, in your release on GitHub, the installer gets attached, and users can download it.

Also, you can optionally automatically publish builds for other platforms (macOS, Linux) in separate jobs.

GitHub docs provide guidance for publishing Python applications and using actions. ([GitHub Docs][2])

## 4. Publishing on GitHub (Releases)

Once your build pipeline is in place, the workflow is:

1. You merge your features / changes.
2. You increment the version (e.g. in `version.txt` or a version constant).
3. You tag the commit:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
4. GitHub Actions triggers the `release` workflow, builds the installer, and uploads it as an artifact.
5. On GitHub, go to **Releases → Draft new release**, associate it with the tag, fill in release notes, and publish it. The uploaded installer will be downloadable from that release.

Users can then download the latest release installer from your GitHub project’s Releases page.

From the Python community discussion: “You can just make a git tag, push it, then in the web UI create a release” ([Discussions on Python.org][3])

## 5. Distribute & Update

* In your repository’s `README.md`, include a “Download latest version” button/link to the latest release.
* Consider adding an auto-update mechanism (optional, more advanced) so your app can check for new releases and suggest upgrades. Some tools like **esky** or custom updater logic can help. ([Stack Overflow][4])
* Keep consistency: every time you want to publish a new version, follow the version bump → tag → release process.
