## 🎮 Quick Demo

Want to see it in action? 

1. **Launch** the application (double-click `start.bat`)
2. **Click** the **"▶️ Run Demo"** button in the header
3. **Watch** as sample images are compressed with before/after comparisons
4. **Review** the results in the status window

The demo uses 5 sample images (various sizes and formats) to showcase the compression capabilities.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Automated Installer (Recommended)

1. Right-click `install.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Follow the on-screen instructions

The installer will:
- ✅ Detect and install Python if needed
- ✅ Install required dependencies (Pillow)
- ✅ Create desktop shortcut
- ✅ Create Start Menu entry
- ✅ Set up uninstaller

### Option 2: Quick Launch (If Python Already Installed)

Simply double-click `launch.bat` to run the application directly.

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Install Python 3.8+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install Pillow
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```powershell
   python image_compressor_gui.py
   ```

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Launch** the application from desktop shortcut or Start Menu
2. **Select** a folder or individual image files using the Browse buttons
3. **Adjust** compression settings (optional):
   - Target Size: How small you want files (default 1 MB)
   - Initial Quality: Starting quality level (85 is recommended)
   - Max Width: Maximum image width in pixels (1920 for web)
4. **Click** "Start Compression" button
5. **Wait** for processing to complete
6. **Find** compressed images in the "Reduced" folder

## ⚙️ Compression Settings Guide

| Use Case | Target Size | Quality | Max Width |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Web/Email** | 1 MB | 85 | 1920px |
| **Social Media** | 0.5 MB | 80 | 1920px |
| **High Quality** | 2 MB | 90 | 2560px |
| **Mobile** | 0.3 MB | 75 | 1280px |

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Pillow**: Image processing library
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11

### How It Works

1. **Image Loading**: Opens images using Pillow (PIL)
2. **Format Conversion**: Converts RGBA/PNG to RGB/JPEG
3. **Smart Resizing**: 
   - Reduces dimensions if larger than max width
   - Maintains aspect ratio
   - Uses LANCZOS resampling for quality
4. **Quality Adjustment**:
   - Starts at specified quality (default 85%)
   - Iteratively reduces quality if file too large
   - Further reduces dimensions if needed
5. **Optimization**: Uses JPEG optimization for smallest file size

### Compression Algorithm

```python
1. Convert image to RGB (if needed)
2. Resize to max_width (if larger)
3. Save with initial quality + optimization
4. While file_size > target_size AND quality > 60:
   - Reduce quality by 5%
   - Re-save
5. While file_size > target_size AND width > 800:
   - Reduce dimensions by 10%
   - Re-save
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed"
- Run `install.ps1` which will download and install Python automatically
- Or manually install from https://python.org and check "Add to PATH"

### "Failed to install Pillow"
- Open PowerShell as Administrator
- Run: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Run: `python -m pip install Pillow`

### Application won't start
- Ensure Python is in your PATH
- Try running from command line: `python image_compressor_gui.py`
- Check error messages

### Images not compressing enough
- Lower the "Initial Quality" setting
- Reduce the "Max Width" to 1280px or 1600px
- Set a smaller "Target Size"

### Images losing too much quality
- Increase "Initial Quality" to 90-95
- Increase "Max Width" to 2560px
- Allow larger "Target Size" (1.5-2 MB)

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.

### Running Tests

```powershell
# Quick test run
.\run_tests.ps1

# With coverage report
.\run_tests.ps1 -Coverage

# Verbose output
.\run_tests.ps1 -Verbose -Coverage
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ **Compression Algorithm**: 95%+ coverage
- ✅ **File Handling**: 90%+ coverage
- ✅ **Error Handling**: 85%+ coverage
- ✅ **Overall**: 85%+ coverage

### Test Categories
