## 🚀 Next Steps

The application is now **production-ready** with:

1. ✅ **Automated builds** - Push tag, get release
2. ✅ **Professional distribution** - EXE + ZIP + checksums
3. ✅ **Quality assurance** - Tests run on every commit
4. ✅ **Easy updates** - Simple version bump process
5. ✅ **User-friendly downloads** - Direct links in README

### To Create First Release:

```bash
# Already have v1.0.0 tag, so create v1.0.1 or push v1.0.0 to trigger workflow
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or create new version:
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1 - CI/CD implementation"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

This will trigger the release workflow and publish the first automated release! 🎊
